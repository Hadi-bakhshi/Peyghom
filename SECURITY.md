## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Peyghom team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential solutions you've identified
- Your name/handle for acknowledgment (optional)

### Response Process

After you have submitted a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Confirmation**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Verification**: Our team will work to verify the vulnerability and its impact.
3. **Remediation Plan**: We'll develop a plan to address the vulnerability.
4. **Communication**: We'll keep you informed about our progress.

## Security Update Policy
